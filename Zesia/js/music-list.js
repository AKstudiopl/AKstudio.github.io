      bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

      bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

    bio: "Born in Syracuse, New York, Austin Post (July 24, 1995) moved to Grapevine, Texas, at the age of 9 and grew up absorbing his father's eclectic record collection which included Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Merle Haggard, playing out his rock star dreams on the video game Guitar Hero. He turned to a real guitar when he was 16 and began teaching himself to play with the help of online tutorial videos. He moved on to community college and worked shifts at a fast-food chain, but when his friend Jason Probst found success with a YouTube gaming channel and moved to Los Angeles, Post followed him to begin his musical career. Living in Probst's San Fernando mansion, he turned his bedroom into a studio while tirelessly working on writing songs, developing his guitar and rap skills, and making his own beats. Taking his moniker from a hip-hop name generator, he developed quickly from making mixtapes to playing in hardcore bands and appearing in Probst's videos. After working with producers FKi and Rex Kudo, he came up with his debut single. Two days after recording it, he uploaded 'White Iverson' to SoundCloud and received a huge response, including millions of plays and praise from Wiz Khalifa and Mac Miller. A deal with Republic Records followed and the single reached Number 14 on the US charts, and after playing at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party, Post featured on Kanye West's single 'Fade' and became the opening act on Justin Bieber's Purpose World Tour in 2016. His debut album Stoney experimented with genres such as country, electronica, pop, and hip-hop and his single 'Congratulations' made the US Top 10. He scored his first Number 1 single with the trap-inspired 'Rockstar' at the end of 2017 and returned the following year with a second album titled Beerbongs & Bentleys, which featured appearances from Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla $ign and G-Eazy. In 2018, he collaborated with Swae Lee on the track 'Sunflower' for the soundtrack of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The track went to Number 1 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot 100, and Rhythmic charts. 2019 saw the arrival of 'Goodbyes' featuring Young Thug and 'Circles' before the release of third studio album Hollywood's Bleeding in September of the same year. The album hit number one on the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart. Featuring guest spots from Roddy Ricch, Doja Cat, Gunna, Fleet Foxes, the Kid Laroi, and the Weeknd, his highly-anticipated fourth studio LP Twelve Carat Toothache appeared in 2022 and debuted at Number 2 on the US rap charts. Preceded by the singles 'Chemical' and 'Mourning,' his fifth studio effort Austin hit the shelves in July 2023.",

    bio: "Delivering lyrics with the speed of a bullet train, Cleveland rapper Machine Gun Kelly experienced a meteoric rise in late 2011 when he transitioned from grinding out self-released mixtapes to working with major labels. From there, the rapper skyrocketed to superstar status, with each of his albums charting in the Top Ten. A beef with , a film career, and even some reality show appearances would follow as the high-powered lyrical rap style of albums like 2019's Hotel Diablo morphed into a driving emo-rock sound on collaborations with  and on the -produced 2020 album Tickets to My Downfall, which topped the Billboard 200. Kelly worked alongside  again in 2022 on album number six, Mainstream Sellout.",

    bio: "With the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier Than Ever,’ the 19-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015, Eilish continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout, her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17 additional countries around the world upon release in 2019, and was the most streamed album of that year. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? was written, produced and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish and brother FINNEAS in their childhood home of Los Angeles. Billie Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY® Awards, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song, ‘No Time To Die.’ Most recently, Billie Eilish was nominated for four additional awards at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2021, and took home both Record of the Year for 'everything i wanted,' and Best Song Written For Visual Media for 'No Time To Die.’ Billie Eilish’s latest album ‘Happier Than Ever’ was written by Billie and her brother FINNEAS, who also produced the album.",

    bio: "Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that earned them grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope by hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their fanbase with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart upon its release in early 2015.",

    bio: "Whether behind the piano in his studio or headlining a sold-out festival, Kygo quietly reaffirms his status as a prodigious talent, forward-thinking producer, dynamic DJ, and influential global superstar. The Norwegian musician born Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll first introduced himself in 2013 and quietly became one of the most ubiquitous hitmakers in the world while emerging as Spotify’s “Breakout Artist of 2015.” “Firestone” ft. Conrad Sewell and “Stole the Show” ft. Parson James help cement Kygo as “the fastest artist to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify.” In the wake of his chart-topping 2016 full- length debut Cloud Nine, he delivered memorable performances on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Good Morning America, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Plus, he notably performed “Carry Me” during the Closing Ceremony of the Rio Olympics.",

    bio: "Multi-Grammy nominated Cuban born singer/songwriter Camila Cabello released her debut solo album, CAMILA in January 2018 to rave reviews. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart at the same time as her single “Havana” reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making her the first solo artist in nearly 15 years to reach the #1 spot on the Hot 100, Billboard 200 & Artist 100 charts in the same week. CAMILA launched its debut at #1 on 110 iTunes charts around the world, breaking the record for most #1 positions for a debut album in iTunes history. Camila also became the #1 artist on global Spotify. She released her RIAA 9x platinum smash hit “Havana,” in August 2017 where it obtained the #1 spot on the pop radio chart. “Havana” is the first song by a female artist to reach No. 1 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary, Pop Songs & Rhythmic Songs charts in 22 years, has earned over 1.1 billion on-demand U.S. streams, according to Nielsen Music, & attained the longest run at No. 1 on Pop Songs for any song by a female artist since 2013. Havana became the most streamed song of all time by a female artist & was the number one song of 2018 globally. Her triple-platinum single “Never Be The Same,” was released in January 2018 & peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Camila became the first artist in history to have two multi-format number one singles as the first two singles from their debut album. In November 2018, she was named the new ambassador for Save the Children.",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Tim Bergling’s death on April 20, 2018 was a shockwave, the global mourning an equal and opposite reaction to the Swedish producer’s intensely uplifting music and the reach it had during his comet streak of a career. As Avicii, Tim Bergling brought a pop sensibility to the electronic scene and helped redefine the global EDM phenomenon. His biggest tracks -“Levels”,  “Wake Me Up”, “Hey Brother” - were pristinely produced anthems of collective catharsis. His rise to fame and subsequent retirement was chronicled in Avicii: TRUE STORIES, filmed over 3 years and directed by Levan Tsikurishvili.  “I will however never let go of music,” he said at the time. “I will continue to speak to my fans through it. In this period, Bergling returned to place he felt best: the studio. This new project, TIM, is a 12-track collection of some of that new Avicii music. Produced primarily between January and April 2018, these songs represent Bergling’s most recent thoughts and vision. This project comes at the request and with the blessing of Bergling’s parents who wanted to see that Tim’s music was heard.  Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark, Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir and Carl Falk, Joakim Berg and Joe Janiak, who collaborated extensively with Bergling throughout his career, were enlisted to complete the tracks. But given how near completion it was, Bergling is still very much the producer of these tracks. While Avicii was Bergling’s brand, TIM is who he really was. ",

    bio: "Award-winning performer and Grammy-nominated songwriter Tove Lo crafts raw, confessional pop shaped by her love of grunge and the pristine sounds of her Swedish homeland. The way her 2013 single Habits (Stay High) swung between joy and despair and frankly depicted drug use and sex made it a distinctive, relatable, multi-platinum hit and a fitting introduction to her uncensored style. She followed it with more uninhibited, confessional music: Her 2014 debut album, Queen of the Clouds, and 2017's BLUE LIPS upheld her reputation for confronting the darker side of love and relationships with thoughtful, provocative, and catchy songwriting. On 2019's Sunshine Kitty, she took a slightly more lighthearted approach without losing any of her edge, while 2022's Dirt Femme lended nuance to her concept of femininity",

    bio: "Nicki Minaj skyrocketed from mixtape phenom to pop star with a unique combination of ferocity and humor she continues to flaunt with razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and a vocal style that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling. The rapper's early days included attempts at an acting career and losing her job at Red Lobster for being rude to customers, but she progressed quickly from MySpace demos to nationally adored mixtapes to household-name status. Pink Friday, Minaj's 2010 album debut, saw her appeal to a broader audience with chart-topping reception. Although she has had similar success with later full-lengths such as 2014's The Pinkprint and 2018's Queen, her singles have made an even greater impact.In just over a decade, Minaj has hit the Top 40 over two dozen times as a headliner with singles such as Super Bass, Starships, and Anaconda. These and other highlights were gathered in 2022 for Queen Radio, Vol. 1, an anthology containing the number one hit Super Freaky Girl among its new songs. Her Top 40 entries as a featured artist are even more numerous and include Kanye West's Monster, David Guetta's Turn Me On, and Ariana Grande's Side to Side. Nicki Minaj was born Onika Tanya Maraj in 1982. Born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago to parents who were both gospel singers, she lived with her grandmother in Saint James until the age of five, when she joined her mother, who had relocated to Queens, New York. In high school she discovered the performing arts, setting her sights on acting as her main pursuit. She eventually transitioned into music, working as part of a group called the Hood$tars in the early 2000s before going solo. In 2007 she was discovered by Dirty Money Entertainment CEO Big Fendi, who happened upon her demos on MySpace and signed Maraj to the label. At Fendi's suggestion, Maraj took on the stage name Nicki Minaj, jumbling her last name to reflect a more ruthless persona. Dirty Money Entertainment released both her 2007 debut mixtape, Playtime Is Over, and its 2008 follow-up, Sucka Free. Industry buzz was already surrounding Minaj on her earliest releases, and these mixtapes featured guest appearances from stars like Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Jadakiss, and Lil' Kim. Throughout the early 2020s, Minaj continued her usual bevy of guest features and collaborations, appearing on tracks by Doja Cat, former Little Mix vocalist Jesy Nelson, BIA, and Elton John. In 2022, she scored more hits as a lead artist with the Lil Baby collaborations Do We Have a Problem? and Bussin, then topped the pop chart with Super Freaky Girl. All three of these singles were included on Queen Radio, Vol. 1, a celebratory anthology released that August. Minaj kicked off 2023 with the flamenco- and trap-inspired Red Ruby da Sleeze, which she followed with a feature on YoungBoy Never Broke Again's WTF. ~ David Jeffries & Fred Thomas",

    bio: "Global pop superstar Dua Lipa released Future Nostalgia, her #1 UK sophomore album, this year to worldwide acclaim. It is one of the best reviewed albums of 2020 and debuted in the top 5 of the Billboard 200 Album Chart. Upon release, Future Nostalgia was the most streamed album in a day by a British female artist globally in Spotify history and has over 4.5 billion streams to date. Dua is the biggest female artist in the world on Spotify and is currently the third biggest artist overall with nearly 60 million monthly listeners. The album’s certified platinum lead single “Don’t Start Now” is a worldwide hit with one billion streams on Spotify alone, and a #2 spot on the Billboard Hot 100, a career high for the pop star. The track also broke her personal best record of weeks at #1 at US Top 40 radio. Dua followed the success of “Don’t Start Now” by releasing smash UK single “Physical,” and her US Top 40 #1 “Break My Heart.” Most recently, Future Nostalgia was shortlisted for UK’s prestigious Mercury Prize. Future Nostalgia is the follow up to Dua’s eponymous 2017 debut, which is certified platinum and spawned 6 platinum tracks. She made BRIT Award history in 2018 by becoming the first female artist to pick up five nominations, with two wins for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo Artist, and received two Grammy awards for Best New Artist and Best Dance Recording in early 2019.",

    bio: "The independent underground would not be what it is today without pioneers like Strange Music co-founder Tech N9ne. Tech’s unparalleled tour schedule and signature rapid-fire “chopper” style combined with the business acumen of Strange Music CEO Travis O’Guin have molded Strange Music into the number one independent hip-hop label in the world.In less than two decades, Tech himself has earned three gold records, sold over two million albums, and made multiple appearances on Forbes’s “Hip-Hop Cash Kings” list. Tech’s multi-faceted skillset has not gone unrecognized by artists of all genres, exemplified by collaborations with such diverse artists as The Doors, Slipknot’s Corey Taylor, Eminem, and Boyz II Men, to name just a few. Everyone from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to Elton John has been spotted bumping Tech N9ne records, a testament to constant reinvention and inarguable excellence that has become standard of Tech’s work. It’s by no coincidence that his latest label-wide collaborative project was named Dominion – Tech N9ne will not stop until he and Strange Music have completely dominated the world of hip-hop and beyond.",

    bio: "Meiko's songs find common ground between indie pop and coffeehouse folk as her distinctive alto vocals share the spotlight alongside acoustic guitars, pianos, and unique arrangements. A longtime songwriter, Meiko was raised in the small town of Roberta, Georgia, where she discovered her love for public performance after singing at a Southern Baptist church. She then took up the guitar, playing her father's Gibson before receiving her own instrument as a birthday present. At the age of 18, Meiko left home for greener pastures, eventually resettling in Los Angeles and scheduling recurring performances at the Hotel Café, a popular haven for L.A.-based singer/songwriters.",

The single La Fema (feat. ) appeared in 2021. Her third long-player, Motomami, offered songwriting collaborations with many artists and producers including  and . The 16-track album was released in March 2022, following a performance of the single Chicken Teriyaki on Saturday Night Live. Rosalía was the first Spanish singer to perform solo on the program.

She soon assembled an eclectic and intriguing curriculum, including appearances in prestigious Spanish and international festivals and collaborations with other artists, and the theater company La Fura del Baus. She also began posting videos of her performances to YouTube and gained a substantial number of social media followers. 2021 saw Rosalía team with Dominican rapper  on the single Linda.

    bio: "From an Hispanic background, Selena Gomez was mostly raised by her mother - former actress Amanda Teefey - and developed her interest in the stage at a young age. She got her first break when she was 10 in the 2002 TV series Barney & Friends and made her film debut a year later in the movie Spy Kids 3-D Game Over. She went on to play Mikayla in the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana and then took the lead role of Alex Russo in Wizards Of Waverly Place. Her first record was the theme song from the series, Everything Is Not What It Seems. Dating fellow Disney star Nick Jonas at the time, Gomez starred in the video for the Jonas Brothers hit Burnin' Up and recorded her own tracks like Cruella de Vil and Fly To Your Heart (soundtrack to the animated film Tinker Bell). She then sang on the Forever The Sickest Kids single Whoa Oh (Me Vs Everyone) and, on the back of an appearance in the movie Another Cinderella Story, had her first hit in 2009 with Tell Me Something I Don't Know. She also appeared in the reality series Jonas Brothers: Living The Dream and recorded the song One And The Same with her close friend Demi Lovato. She subsequently decided to concentrate on her music, forming the band Selena Gomez & The Scene and recorded her 2009 debut album Kiss & Tell, producing the hit single Naturally and breaking into the US Top 10. Meanwhile she continued her acting career, playing a more adult role in the movie Ramona & Beezus, appeared in various TV commercials and launched her own fashion range before releasing her second album A Year Without Rain. Gomez gained further attention when she started dating Justin Bieber and had another hit in 2013 with Come & Get It before releasing what was billed as her first solo album without The Scene, Stars Dance.

    bio: "Rihanna established her pop credentials in 2005 with Pon de Replay, a boisterous debut single that narrowly missed the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and fast-tracked her to becoming one of the most popular, acclaimed, and dynamic artists in postmillennial contemporary music. Until the Barbados native took a break from releasing music in the late 2010s, she was a near-constant presence in the upper reaches of the pop chart. Through 2017, mixing and matching pop, dancehall, R&B, EDM, and adult contemporary material, she headlined 11 number one hits, including Umbrella and Only Girl (In the World), singles that earned her two of her nine Grammy awards. More than just a singles artist, Rihanna continually pushed ahead stylistically with her LPs, highlighted by the bold Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), the steely Rated R (2009), and the composed Anti (2016), all of which confounded expectations and placed within the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with eventual multi-platinum certifications.",

    bio: "Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in music history, and easily one of rap's biggest crossover successes. He was the first white rapper since  to garner both sales and critical respect, but his impact has exceeded this confining distinction. On sheer technical skills, Eminem is one of the greatest MCs of his generation: rapid, fluid, dexterous, and unpredictable, capable of pulling off long-form narratives or withering asides.",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: a singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras, creating a sound that's idiosyncratic and personal. Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path -- elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits The A Team, Sing, Thinking Out Loud, and Shape of You -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut, +. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including Khalid, Camilla Cabello, Cardi B, Justin Biber, Chris Stapleton and Bruno Mars",

Not yet 30, the Brussels-born DJ/producer who teaches music production on the side, has proven that he can cook up dance hits in the EDM and House arena, with the best of them. With an invigorating take on electronic music, Jay offers a welcoming change in the fast-paced music world. This unassuming Algerian-Moroccan, Belgium raised computer whiz kid was introduced to electronic music in 2011 with the advent of Dubstep.",

    bio: "Whether you’re aware of Minus Manus already or not, the impact of his influence across European pop music can not be denied. Real name Magnus Bertelsen, the young artist has amassed Number One singles in five different countries and over 2 billion worldwide streams through his work as a producer and songwriter. He helped Alan Walker land some huge international hits with the likes of ‘Sing Me To Sleep’, ‘Different World’ and ‘Lily’ (the last one has been in the Billboard EDM top20 for over 20 weeks). But now the Norwegian mastermind has allowed his take on intense, dynamic and infectious dance-pop to blossom as he goes it alone. Taking inspiration from Max Martin’s pop production and mixing it with dance floor ready beats, Minus Manus could soon become as synonymous with main room clubs himself.",

    bio: "An effortless storyteller with a pure and unfiltered singing talent and songwriting ability, Mabel McVey has an instinctive gift of melody far beyond her twenty three years. Indeed Mabel has made quite the impression since bursting on to the scene in September 2015 with her release‘Know Me Better’. Quietly released onto Mabel’s personal SoundCloud, the single didn’t remain a secret for long, putting the wheels in motion for Mabel to become a fresh and exciting name amongst a brand new generation of r’n’b chanteuses. In the three since, Mabel’s growth (musically, emotionally, visually) has been extraordinary. Her formative material led to the surprise breakthrough of ‘Finders Keepers’ in 2017, which went platinum, spent 5 weeks in the top 10, and saw Mabel nominated for her first BRIT Award (Critics’ Choice). She has gone from playing nervous, intimate shows to touring with Harry Styles, selling out her own dates around the world (including London’s Brixton Academy) and has clocked up increasingly-surreal experiences en route(which includes playing Wembley Stadium in a Burberry catsuit and rainbow flag). Over two million single sales in the UK and over half a billion streams followed. Mabel has emerged as one of the UK’s most positive, candid lyrical voices, with songs that frequently explore everything from identity, the challenges of modern relationships, and working out who you are and what you want.",

    bio: "Modern Metal from Germany, The darkest hours make us what we are. We all have this voice inside our head, our very own enemy, keeping us from following our dreams. Sometimes we need to forget the past and start over. Like a Phoenix, we will rise from the flames. We will set the sky on fire. The heat will vaporize our tears and burn our scars to dust. It is always darkest before the dawn. We are the masters of our minds. We are the ENEMY INSIDE. Nastassja Giulia - Vocals // Evan K - Lead Guitars // Dave Hadarik - Rhythm Guitars // Dominik Stotzem - Bass // Fabian Dührssen - Drums",

    bio: "Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomena: a superstar who managed to completely cross over from country to the mainstream. Others have performed similar moves -- notably, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson both became enduring pop culture icons based on their 1970s work -- but Swift shed her country roots like they were a second skin; it was a necessary molting to reveal she was perhaps the sharpest, savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse. These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute Tim McGraw, but her second album, 2008's Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience. Fearless wound up having considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked up six platinum singles on the strength of the Top Ten hits Love Story and You Belong with Me, but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Speak Now, delivered almost two years later, consolidated that success and moved Swift into the stratosphere of superstardom. Her popularity only increased over her next three albums -- Red (2012), 1989 (2014), Reputation (2017) -- and found her moving assuredly into a pop realm where she already belonged. Even when she scaled back her approach with 2020's stripped-down sibling releases folklore and Evermore, she remained atop the pop world, a position she maintained with re-recordings of her back catalog along with Midnights, a moody album released in 2022.",

    bio: "Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he hit the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning Hotline Bling and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring the Weeknd's early work, starting the OVO Sound label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake's constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world's most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022's Honestly, Nevermind became cultural events.",

    bio: "Jeder im Alter von 5 bis 95 Jahren kennt Lena. Das Mädchen von nebenan, das Vorbild, unser Star von Oslo, die nationale Sensation. Mit ihrer frechen und unverfälschten Art hat sie über Nacht unsere Herzen erobert. Für die einen ist sie dabei arrogant und trotzig. Für andere ist sie unzensiert, ehrlich und direkt. Lena ist all das, gleichzeitig nichts von dem und doch so viel mehr. Am Ende ist Lena nur Lena - eine junge Frau, die von einem Tag auf den anderen in das globale Rampenlicht trat. Sie musste lernen, mit ihren Erfahrungen wachsen und die Autonomie ﬁnden, ihren eigenen Wünschen fernab von äußeren Erwartungshaltungen nachzugehen. In ihrem 5. Studioalbum hat man mehr denn je das Gefühl, dass ihr das gelungen ist. Lena ist nach wie vor Lena und trotzdem anders - befreit, erwachsen und voller Lebensfreude. Ihre Botschaft lautet Only Love und das hört und spürt man in jedem Song.",

    bio: "Daria Zawiałow - jeden z najmocniejszych głosów na polskiej scenie muzycznej. Autorka tekstów oraz kompozytorka. Swoją charyzmą rozkochała w sobie tysiące fanów i stanęła w szeregu topowych polskich wokalistek. Na scenie jest wulkanem energii. Poza sceną jest skromną, normalną dziewczyną, lecz nadal świadomą i bezkompromisową artystką. W 2016 roku szumnie zaznaczyła swoją obecność na rynku singlami „Malinowy Chruśniak“ i „Kundel Bury“. Na początku 2017 roku zadebiutowała albumem „A kysz!“. Niemal od razu po premierze Daria została okrzyknięta objawieniem roku, a chwilę potem została nagrodzona dwoma Fryderykami. Dwa lata później światło dzienne ujrzał album „Helsinki“. Płyta po kilku miesiącach uzyskała status platynowej i przez 70 tygodni utrzymywała się na OLiS. „Hej, Hej!“ – potrójnie platynowy singiel z płyty – przez 4 tygodnie z rzędu był najczęściej granym utworem w polskich radiach. „Helsinki” również zostały uhonorowane Fryderykiem. W międzyczasie, z fantastycznym zespołem u boku, Daria zagrała setki koncertów na największych scenach w Polsce. Jej ostatnia trasa Helsinki Tour jeszcze przed startem została wyprzedana. W 2019 roku Daria była najczęściej słuchaną polską artystką na Spotify. Rok później została ambasadorką trasy Męskie Granie współtworząc przebój ”Świt”. W czerwcu 2021 roku ukazał się trzeci, bestsellerowy album Darii pt. „Wojny i Noce”. Wszystkie albumy artystka współtworzyła wraz z wieloletnim przyjacielem i producentem - Michałem Kushem.",

    bio: "With his slicked-back hair and leather jacket, G-Eazy was known as 'the James Dean of rap' when he debuted in the late 2000s. Armed with bars that detailed hedonistic excess and conflicted inner turmoil, he steadily climbed the charts in the 2010s on the strength of his hit duet with Bebe Rexha, 'Me, Myself & I,' from his major-label debut, 2014's These Things Happen. He repeated that success in 2017 with third album The Beautiful & Damned, which paired him with Halsey on the platinum 'Him & I,' and A$AP Rocky and Cardi B on the Top Four hit 'No Limit.' Without losing any of his swagger, G-Eazy has matured, even singing and exploring a more introspective sound, as on the 2020 side project Everything's Strange Here and 2021 full-length These Things Happen Too. Born Gerald Earl Gillum in Oakland, California, G-Eazy launched his career while still in college at Loyola University in New Orleans, heading up a hip-hop crew named the Bay Boyz while releasing his solo debut, The Epidemic LP, in 2009. Two years later, his mixtape The Endless Summer landed with the hit redo of Dion's 'Runaround Sue.' In 2012 he released his second LP, Must Be Nice, hitting the road with Hoodie Allen and joining the Vans Warped Tour. In 2014 he returned with his first major-label release, These Things Happen (RCA). As his popularity grew in the following year, he embarked on an extensive international tour and recorded his fourth album. When It's Dark Out was released in late 2015 and included a hit duet with Bebe Rexha, 'Me, Myself & I.' Dark would go on to peak at number five on the Billboard 200 and top the R&B/Hip-Hop chart. In the summer of 2016, while on tour with Logic, YG, and Yo Gotti, Eazy appeared on Britney Spears' comeback single 'Make Me,' which entered the Top 20 of the Hot 100. 'Some Kind of Drug,' his single featuring Marc E. Bassy, arrived at the end of the year and would enter the singles charts in early 2017. At the beginning of the year, G-Eazy also teamed up with Carnage for the EP Step Brothers. By mid-year, he released the single 'No Limit,' which featured A$AP Rocky and Cardi B. The multi-platinum track climbed into the Top Five of the Hot 100, becoming his highest-charting single to date. This was followed by a second platinum chart hit, 'Him & I,' which featured his then-girlfriend Halsey. Both tracks were included on his third studio album, The Beautiful & Damned, which was released in December 2017. The double-disc set peaked at number three on the Billboard 200. In 2018 Eazy teamed up with Yo Gotti and YBN Nahmir for the single '1942,' which appeared on the Uncle Drew soundtrack. Eazy's 2019 output included the EP B-Sides, the single 'West Coast' featuring Blueface, and a bevy of features on tracks by Chris Brown, Carnage, and T-Pain. He closed the year with a second EP, Scary Nights, which recruited Moneybagg Yo, French Montana, Miguel, and others.In 2020, Eazy found inspiration in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, taking the opportunity to try new things and reflect. The results wound up on Everything's Strange Here, a drastic shift in style that set his rap braggadocio aside in favor of introspective indie alternative pop. Singing instead of rapping, he covered the Korgis and David Bowie, while also sampling Pixies. By the end of the year, he had also collaborated with Blackbear on the song 'Hate the Way,' before releasing his seventh studio album, 2021's These Things Happen Too. Included on the album, was the Hot 100 single 'Running Wild (Tumblr Girls 2) featuring Kossisko. There were also guest appearances by Demi Lovato, Lil Wayne, Marc E. Bassy, and others. It reached number 11 on the Top R&B/Hip-hop Albums chart and number 19 on the Billboard 200. After a year-long hiatus, Eazy returned in 2023 with the reflective single Tulips & Roses.

    bio: "Los Angeles' Julia Michaels is a gifted singer and songwriter with a bent toward R&B-inflected, dance-oriented pop. Before launching her performing career, Michaels had composed songs for Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran, Shakira, and many others. She then transitioned to feature roles, appearing on Jason Derulo's 'Trade Hearts' and Kygo's 'Carry Me.'

    bio: "Six million album sales. Four top five studio albums, two of which hit the UK number one. World tours in front of 3.3 million people. Over 200 million Spotify streams. A 2007 single, This Is The Life, that went to number one in ten countries. Fifteen years of continued international success, in which she has resolutely and unfailingly gone her own way. And now her best album yet. The Human Demands, produced by Jim Abbiss of Arctic Monkeys / Kasabian fame, reconnects Macdonald with her alternative roots, and her ability to write classic songs that sound like they have always existed, albeit with a new, Bruce Springsteen-like widescreen grandeur and ambition that suits her powerful, resonant contralto. The album also takes on the kind of heavy themes most of us have to deal with sooner or later: falling in love, burning bridges, facing depression, growing up. All this from an acoustic guitar-playing indie rocker who only ever wanted to share a bill with Travis at Scotland’s T In The Park festival. She has weathered fifteen years of major success in music while remaining her own woman, but now, all these years later, Amy Macdonald is back where she began: with an album that captures the essence of who she is. “I’m back to making music I like and just putting it out in a pure way. It has given me a new love for what I do, all over again.”",
