      bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

    bio: "Delivering lyrics with the speed of a bullet train, Cleveland rapper Machine Gun Kelly experienced a meteoric rise in late 2011 when he transitioned from grinding out self-released mixtapes to working with major labels. From there, the rapper skyrocketed to superstar status, with each of his albums charting in the Top Ten. A beef with , a film career, and even some reality show appearances would follow as the high-powered lyrical rap style of albums like 2019's Hotel Diablo morphed into a driving emo-rock sound on collaborations with  and on the -produced 2020 album Tickets to My Downfall, which topped the Billboard 200. Kelly worked alongside  again in 2022 on album number six, Mainstream Sellout.",

    bio: "With the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier Than Ever,’ the 19-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015, Eilish continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout, her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17 additional countries around the world upon release in 2019, and was the most streamed album of that year. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? was written, produced and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish and brother FINNEAS in their childhood home of Los Angeles. Billie Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY® Awards, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song, ‘No Time To Die.’ Most recently, Billie Eilish was nominated for four additional awards at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2021, and took home both Record of the Year for 'everything i wanted,' and Best Song Written For Visual Media for 'No Time To Die.’ Billie Eilish’s latest album ‘Happier Than Ever’ was written by Billie and her brother FINNEAS, who also produced the album.",

The Norwegian musician born Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll first introduced himself in 2013 and quietly became one of the most ubiquitous hitmakers in the world while emerging as Spotify’s “Breakout Artist of 2015.” “Firestone” ft. Conrad Sewell and “Stole the Show” ft. Parson James help cement Kygo as “the fastest artist to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify.” In the wake of his chart-topping 2016 full- length debut Cloud Nine, he delivered memorable performances on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Good Morning America, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Plus, he notably performed “Carry Me” during the Closing Ceremony of the Rio Olympics.",

Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

    bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

    bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

After winning a Swedish singing competition at the age of eight, Larsson crashed the mainstream in the mid-2010s with a string of Swedish number ones like Lush Life and Never Forget You, which were certified multi-platinum around the world. Those tracks landed on her 2017 chart-topping, multi-platinum breakthrough So Good, a Top Ten hit across Europe and Australasia.

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Tim Bergling’s death on April 20, 2018 was a shockwave, the global mourning an equal and opposite reaction to the Swedish producer’s intensely uplifting music and the reach it had during his comet streak of a career. As Avicii, Tim Bergling brought a pop sensibility to the electronic scene and helped redefine the global EDM phenomenon. His biggest tracks -“Levels”,  “Wake Me Up”, “Hey Brother” - were pristinely produced anthems of collective catharsis. His rise to fame and subsequent retirement was chronicled in Avicii: TRUE STORIES, filmed over 3 years and directed by Levan Tsikurishvili.  “I will however never let go of music,” he said at the time. “I will continue to speak to my fans through it. In this period, Bergling returned to place he felt best: the studio. This new project, TIM, is a 12-track collection of some of that new Avicii music. Produced primarily between January and April 2018, these songs represent Bergling’s most recent thoughts and vision. This project comes at the request and with the blessing of Bergling’s parents who wanted to see that Tim’s music was heard.  Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark, Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir and Carl Falk, Joakim Berg and Joe Janiak, who collaborated extensively with Bergling throughout his career, were enlisted to complete the tracks. But given how near completion it was, Bergling is still very much the producer of these tracks. While Avicii was Bergling’s brand, TIM is who he really was. ",
