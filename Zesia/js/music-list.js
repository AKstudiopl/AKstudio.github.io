      bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.  TRENCH finds Twenty One Pilots fearlessly reimagining the possibilities of their music through the same candid expression and genuine identity that helped to cement their place as one of the largest bands in the world.",

    bio: "Delivering lyrics with the speed of a bullet train, Cleveland rapper Machine Gun Kelly experienced a meteoric rise in late 2011 when he transitioned from grinding out self-released mixtapes to working with major labels. From there, the rapper skyrocketed to superstar status, with each of his albums charting in the Top Ten. A beef with , a film career, and even some reality show appearances would follow as the high-powered lyrical rap style of albums like 2019's Hotel Diablo morphed into a driving emo-rock sound on collaborations with  and on the -produced 2020 album Tickets to My Downfall, which topped the Billboard 200. Kelly worked alongside  again in 2022 on album number six, Mainstream Sellout.",

    bio: "With the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier Than Ever,’ the 19-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015, Eilish continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout, her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17 additional countries around the world upon release in 2019, and was the most streamed album of that year. WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? was written, produced and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish and brother FINNEAS in their childhood home of Los Angeles. Billie Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY® Awards, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song, ‘No Time To Die.’ Most recently, Billie Eilish was nominated for four additional awards at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards in 2021, and took home both Record of the Year for 'everything i wanted,' and Best Song Written For Visual Media for 'No Time To Die.’ Billie Eilish’s latest album ‘Happier Than Ever’ was written by Billie and her brother FINNEAS, who also produced the album.",

    bio: "Whether behind the piano in his studio or headlining a sold-out festival, Kygo quietly reaffirms his status as a prodigious talent, forward-thinking producer, dynamic DJ, and influential global superstar. The Norwegian musician born Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll first introduced himself in 2013 and quietly became one of the most ubiquitous hitmakers in the world while emerging as Spotify’s “Breakout Artist of 2015.” “Firestone” ft. Conrad Sewell and “Stole the Show” ft. Parson James help cement Kygo as “the fastest artist to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify.” In the wake of his chart-topping 2016 full- length debut Cloud Nine, he delivered memorable performances on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Good Morning America, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Plus, he notably performed “Carry Me” during the Closing Ceremony of the Rio Olympics.",

    bio: "Twenty One Pilots shook the world with the release of their 2015 LP BLURRYFACE, an album that would go on to sell over 7 million copies worldwide and earn the band their first ever GRAMMY® Award as they shattered longstanding chart records, and captivated audiences worldwide on sold-out arena runs and at international festivals.  Now three years later, the duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have returned to write the next chapter of their story with TRENCH, the band’s highly anticipated new studio album.

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Tim Bergling’s death on April 20, 2018 was a shockwave, the global mourning an equal and opposite reaction to the Swedish producer’s intensely uplifting music and the reach it had during his comet streak of a career. As Avicii, Tim Bergling brought a pop sensibility to the electronic scene and helped redefine the global EDM phenomenon. His biggest tracks -“Levels”,  “Wake Me Up”, “Hey Brother” - were pristinely produced anthems of collective catharsis. His rise to fame and subsequent retirement was chronicled in Avicii: TRUE STORIES, filmed over 3 years and directed by Levan Tsikurishvili.  “I will however never let go of music,” he said at the time. “I will continue to speak to my fans through it. In this period, Bergling returned to place he felt best: the studio. This new project, TIM, is a 12-track collection of some of that new Avicii music. Produced primarily between January and April 2018, these songs represent Bergling’s most recent thoughts and vision. This project comes at the request and with the blessing of Bergling’s parents who wanted to see that Tim’s music was heard.  Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark, Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir and Carl Falk, Joakim Berg and Joe Janiak, who collaborated extensively with Bergling throughout his career, were enlisted to complete the tracks. But given how near completion it was, Bergling is still very much the producer of these tracks. While Avicii was Bergling’s brand, TIM is who he really was. ",

    bio: "Award-winning performer and Grammy-nominated songwriter Tove Lo crafts raw, confessional pop shaped by her love of grunge and the pristine sounds of her Swedish homeland. The way her 2013 single Habits (Stay High) swung between joy and despair and frankly depicted drug use and sex made it a distinctive, relatable, multi-platinum hit and a fitting introduction to her uncensored style. She followed it with more uninhibited, confessional music: Her 2014 debut album, Queen of the Clouds, and 2017's BLUE LIPS upheld her reputation for confronting the darker side of love and relationships with thoughtful, provocative, and catchy songwriting. On 2019's Sunshine Kitty, she took a slightly more lighthearted approach without losing any of her edge, while 2022's Dirt Femme lended nuance to her concept of femininity",

    bio: "Nicki Minaj skyrocketed from mixtape phenom to pop star with a unique combination of ferocity and humor she continues to flaunt with razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and a vocal style that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling. The rapper's early days included attempts at an acting career and losing her job at Red Lobster for being rude to customers, but she progressed quickly from MySpace demos to nationally adored mixtapes to household-name status. Pink Friday, Minaj's 2010 album debut, saw her appeal to a broader audience with chart-topping reception. Although she has had similar success with later full-lengths such as 2014's The Pinkprint and 2018's Queen, her singles have made an even greater impact.",

    bio: "Global pop superstar Dua Lipa released Future Nostalgia, her #1 UK sophomore album, this year to worldwide acclaim. It is one of the best reviewed albums of 2020 and debuted in the top 5 of the Billboard 200 Album Chart. Upon release, Future Nostalgia was the most streamed album in a day by a British female artist globally in Spotify history and has over 4.5 billion streams to date. Dua is the biggest female artist in the world on Spotify and is currently the third biggest artist overall with nearly 60 million monthly listeners. The album’s certified platinum lead single “Don’t Start Now” is a worldwide hit with one billion streams on Spotify alone, and a #2 spot on the Billboard Hot 100, a career high for the pop star. The track also broke her personal best record of weeks at #1 at US Top 40 radio. Dua followed the success of “Don’t Start Now” by releasing smash UK single “Physical,” and her US Top 40 #1 “Break My Heart.” Most recently, Future Nostalgia was shortlisted for UK’s prestigious Mercury Prize. Future Nostalgia is the follow up to Dua’s eponymous 2017 debut, which is certified platinum and spawned 6 platinum tracks. She made BRIT Award history in 2018 by becoming the first female artist to pick up five nominations, with two wins for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo Artist, and received two Grammy awards for Best New Artist and Best Dance Recording in early 2019.",

    bio: "The independent underground would not be what it is today without pioneers like Strange Music co-founder Tech N9ne. Tech’s unparalleled tour schedule and signature rapid-fire “chopper” style combined with the business acumen of Strange Music CEO Travis O’Guin have molded Strange Music into the number one independent hip-hop label in the world.In less than two decades, Tech himself has earned three gold records, sold over two million albums, and made multiple appearances on Forbes’s “Hip-Hop Cash Kings” list. Tech’s multi-faceted skillset has not gone unrecognized by artists of all genres, exemplified by collaborations with such diverse artists as The Doors, Slipknot’s Corey Taylor, Eminem, and Boyz II Men, to name just a few. Everyone from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to Elton John has been spotted bumping Tech N9ne records, a testament to constant reinvention and inarguable excellence that has become standard of Tech’s work. It’s by no coincidence that his latest label-wide collaborative project was named Dominion – Tech N9ne will not stop until he and Strange Music have completely dominated the world of hip-hop and beyond.",

    bio: "Meiko's songs find common ground between indie pop and coffeehouse folk as her distinctive alto vocals share the spotlight alongside acoustic guitars, pianos, and unique arrangements. A longtime songwriter, Meiko was raised in the small town of Roberta, Georgia, where she discovered her love for public performance after singing at a Southern Baptist church. She then took up the guitar, playing her father's Gibson before receiving her own instrument as a birthday present. At the age of 18, Meiko left home for greener pastures, eventually resettling in Los Angeles and scheduling recurring performances at the Hotel Café, a popular haven for L.A.-based singer/songwriters.",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

    bio: "Ariana Grande is perhaps the quintessential pop star of the last half of the 2010s, capturing the era's spirit and style. Emerging in 2013 with the hit single The Way, Grande initially appeared to be the heir to the throne of , due in part to her powerhouse vocals. With its  production, her debut Yours Truly underscored her debt to '90s R&B, but Grande quickly incorporated hip-hop and EDM into her music.",

    bio: "Rihanna established her pop credentials in 2005 with Pon de Replay, a boisterous debut single that narrowly missed the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and fast-tracked her to becoming one of the most popular, acclaimed, and dynamic artists in postmillennial contemporary music. Until the Barbados native took a break from releasing music in the late 2010s, she was a near-constant presence in the upper reaches of the pop chart. Through 2017, mixing and matching pop, dancehall, R&B, EDM, and adult contemporary material, she headlined 11 number one hits, including Umbrella and Only Girl (In the World), singles that earned her two of her nine Grammy awards. More than just a singles artist, Rihanna continually pushed ahead stylistically with her LPs, highlighted by the bold Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), the steely Rated R (2009), and the composed Anti (2016), all of which confounded expectations and placed within the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with eventual multi-platinum certifications.",

    bio: "The moment you find your voice, you step into yourself and actualize your potential. At this point, expectations no longer matter, fear disappears, and everything changes. Against The Current not only embrace their voice, but project it louder than ever. After hundreds of millions of streams, major collaborations with the likes of Riot Games, and countless packed shows, the trio—Chrissy Costanza [vocals], Dan Gow [guitar], and Will Ferri [drums]—lift themselves up to this moment with their new music. Dan observes, “We dove back into early inspirations like Taking Back Sunday and incorporated those vibes into what we do. It fueled us to keep going.” In the end, Against The Current will stir up the same frenzy and fire in audiences as well with this music. “Musically, it’s back to the three of us in a room together, and you’ll hear it,” adds Will. “In a lot of ways, it’s like we’re just getting started—even though it’s been ten years. It feels good.” “This process was really empowering,” Chrissy concludes. “It also reminded me how much I love rock music and how this band was founded on that love. When you listen to us, I want you to know you’re in control. If you don’t like something, you can make a change. I realized I don’t want to sit around feeling sorry for myself…I want more. I want to inspire everyone to chase their dreams to no end.”",

W roku 2020 roku jej single  ,  i  pokochała cała Polska - na tyle, że debiutancka płyta sanah „Królowa dram” zadebiutowała na 1. miejscu list sprzedaży płyt OLiS i szybko zyskała status Platyny. Rok pozniej sukces ten powtorzyla z hitowym albumem „Irenka” - hity Ale jazz! , etc. (na disco) czy ten Stan ponownie podbiły wszystkie możliwe listy przebojów. Jesienią ukaże się reedycja „Irenki” a na niej m.in. najsłynniejszy nieznany utwór ostatnich miesięcy - Kolońska i szlugi!",

    bio: "Rihanna established her pop credentials in 2005 with Pon de Replay, a boisterous debut single that narrowly missed the top of the Billboard Hot 100 and fast-tracked her to becoming one of the most popular, acclaimed, and dynamic artists in postmillennial contemporary music. Until the Barbados native took a break from releasing music in the late 2010s, she was a near-constant presence in the upper reaches of the pop chart. Through 2017, mixing and matching pop, dancehall, R&B, EDM, and adult contemporary material, she headlined 11 number one hits, including Umbrella and Only Girl (In the World), singles that earned her two of her nine Grammy awards. More than just a singles artist, Rihanna continually pushed ahead stylistically with her LPs, highlighted by the bold Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), the steely Rated R (2009), and the composed Anti (2016), all of which confounded expectations and placed within the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with eventual multi-platinum certifications.",
